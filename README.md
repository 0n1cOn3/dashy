#### Deploying from Docker Hub üê≥

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system

```
docker run -p 8080:80 lissy93/dashy
```

Or

```docker
docker run -d \
  -p 4000:80 \
  -v /root/my-local-conf.yml:/app/public/conf.yml \
  --name my-dashboard \
  --restart=always \
  lissy93/dashy:latest
```

You can also build the Docker container from source, by cloning the repo, cd'ing into it and running `docker build .` and `docker compose up`.
#### Deploying from Source üöÄ

You will need both [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and the latest or LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system

- Get Code: `git clone git@github.com:Lissy93/dashy.git` and `cd dashy`
- Configuration: Fill in you're settings in `./public/conf.yml`
- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Build: `yarn build`
- Run: `yarn start`

#### Deploy to the Cloud

Dashy supports 1-Click deployments on several popular cloud platforms. To spin up a new instance, just click a link below:

#### Basic Commands

The following commands can be run on Dashy.

- `yarn build` - Builds the project for production, and outputs it into `./dist`
- `yarn start` - Starts a web server, and serves up the production site from `./dist`
- `yarn validate-config` - Parses and validates your `conf.yml` against Dashy's [schema](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/utils/ConfigSchema.json)
- `yarn health-check` - Checks the health and status of Dashy's Node server
- `yarn pm2-start` - Starts the app using the [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) process manager
- `yarn dev` - Starts the development server with hot reloading, linting, testing and verbose messaging
- `yarn lint` - Lints code to ensure it follows a consistent neat style
- `yarn test` - Runs tests, and outputs results
- `yarn install` - Install all dependencies

If you are using Docker, than precede each command with `docker exec -it [container-id]`, where container id can be found by running `docker ps`, e.g. `docker exec -it 92490c12baff yarn build`.
If you prefer [`NPM`](https://docs.npmjs.com), then just replace `yarn` with `npm run` in the following commands.

In Docker, [healthchecks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) are pre-configured to monitor the uptime and response times of Dashy, and the status of which will show in your Docker monitoring app, or the `docker ps` command, or the container logs, using: `docker inspect --format "{{json .State.Health }}" [container-id]`.

## Configuring üîß

> For full configuration documentation, see: [**Configuring**](./docs/configuring.md)

Dashy is configured with a single [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file, located at `./public/conf.yml` (or `./app/public/conf.yml` for Docker). Any other optional user-customizable assets are also located in the `./public/` directory, e.g. `favicon.ico`, `manifest.json`, `robots.txt` and `web-icons/*`. If you are using Docker, the easiest way to method is to mount a Docker volume (e.g. `-v /root/my-local-conf.yml:/app/public/conf.yml`)

In the production environment, the app needs to be rebuilt in order for changes to take effect. This should happen automatically, but can also be triggered by running `yarn build`, or `docker exec -it [container-id] yarn build` if you are using Docker (where container ID can be found by running `docker ps`).

You can check that your config matches Dashy's [schema](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/utils/ConfigSchema.json) before deploying, by running `yarn validate-config.`

It is now possible also possible to update Dashy's config directly through the UI, and have changes written to disk. You can disable this feature by setting: `appConfig.allowConfigEdit: false`. If you are using users within Dashy, then you need to be logged in to a user of `type: admin` in order to modify the configuration globally. You can also trigger a rebuild of the app through the UI (Settings --> Rebuild).

You may find these [example config](https://gist.github.com/Lissy93/000f712a5ce98f212817d20bc16bab10) helpful for getting you started

## Theming üé®

> For full theming documentation, see: [**Theming**](./docs/theming.md)

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://i.ibb.co/BVSHV1v/dashy-themes-slideshow.gif">
    <img alt="Example Themes" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/dashy/master/docs/assets/theme-slideshow.gif" width="400" />
  </a>
</p>

The app comes with a number of built-in themes, but it's also easy to write you're own. All colors, and most other CSS properties make use of CSS variables, which makes customizing the look and feel of Dashy very easy.

You can also apply custom CSS overrides directly through the UI (Under Config menu --> Custom CSS), or specify it in your config file under `appConfig.customCss`. If you have a lot of custom styles, you can pass in the path to a stylesheet, in `appConfig.externalStyleSheet`.

**[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#dashy)**

---

## Icons üß∏

> For full iconography documentation, see: [**Icons**](./docs/icons.md)

Both sections and items can have an icon associated with them, and defined under the `icon` attribute. There are many options for icons, including Font Awesome support, automatic fetching from favicon, programmatically generated icons and direct local or remote URLs.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="https://i.ibb.co/GTVmZnc/dashy-example-icons.png" />
</p>

- **Favicon**: Set `icon: favicon` to fetch a services icon automatically from the URL of the corresponding application
- **Font-Awesome**: To use any font-awesome icon, specify the category, followed by the icon name, e.g. `fas fa-rocket` or `fab fa-monero`. You can also use Pro icons if you have a license key, just set it under `appConfig.fontAwesomeKey`
- **Generative**: Setting `icon: generative`, will generate a unique for a given service, based on it's URL or IP
- **Emoji**: Use an emoji as a tile icon, by putting the emoji's code as the icon attribute. Emojis can be specified either as emojis (`üöÄ`), unicode (`'U+1F680'`) or shortcode (`':rocket:'`).
- **URL**: You can also pass in a URL to an icon asset, hosted either locally or using any CDN service. E.g. `icon: https://i.ibb.co/710B3Yc/space-invader-x256.png`.
- **Local Image**: To use a local image, store it in `./public/item-icons/` (or create a volume in Docker: `-v /local/image/directory:/app/public/item-icons/`) , and reference it by name and extension - e.g. set `icon: image.png` to use `./public/item-icon/image.png`. You can also use sub-folders here if you have a lot of icons, to keep them organized.

## Cloud Backup & Sync ‚òÅ

> For full backup documentation, see: [**Cloud Backup & Sync**](./docs/backup-restore.md)

Dashy has an **optional** built-in feature for securely backing up your config to a hosted cloud service, and then restoring it on another instance. This feature is totally optional, and if you do not enable it, then Dashy will not make any external network requests.

This is useful not only for backing up your configuration off-site, but it also enables Dashy to be used without having write a YAML config file, and makes it possible to use a public hosted instance, without the need to self-host.

All data is encrypted before being sent to the backend. In Dashy, this is done in [`CloudBackup.js`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/utils/CloudBackup.js), using [crypto.js](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js)'s AES method, using the users chosen password as the key. The data is then sent to a [Cloudflare worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-workers-works) (a platform for running serverless functions), and stored in a [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-kv-works) data store.

**[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#dashy)**

---

## Authentication üíÇ

> For full authentication documentation, see: [**Authentication**](./docs/authentication.md)

Dashy has a built-in login feature, which can be used for basic access control. To enable this feature, add an `auth` attribute under `appConfig`, containing an array of users, each with a username, SHA-256 hashed password and optional user type.

```yaml
appConfig:
  auth:
    - user: alicia
      hash: 4D1E58C90B3B94BCAD9848ECCACD6D2A8C9FBC5CA913304BBA5CDEAB36FEEFA3
```
At present, access control is handled on the frontend, and therefore in security-critical situations, it is recommended to use an alternate method for authentication, such as [Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/), a VPN or web server and firewall rules.

<p align="center">

    width="400"
  />
</p>


**[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#dashy)**

---

## Status Indicators üö¶

> For full monitoring documentation, see: [**Status Indicators**](./docs/status-indicators.md)

Dashy has an optional feature that can display a small icon next to each of your running services, indicating it's current status. This is useful if you are using Dashy as your homelab's start page, as it gives you an overview of the health of each of your running services. Hovering over the indicator will show additional information, including average response time and an error message for services which are down.

By default, this feature is off, but you can enable it globally by setting `appConfig.statusCheck: true`, or enable/ disable it for an individual item, with `item[n].statusCheck`. You can also specify an time interval in seconds under `appConfig.statusCheckInterval`, which will determine how often to recheck services, if this value is `0`, then status is only checked on initial page load, this is default behavior.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Status Checks demo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/dashy/master/docs/assets/status-check-demo.gif" width="600" />
</p>

## Opening Methods üñ±Ô∏è

One of the primary purposes of Dashy is to make launching commonly used apps and services as quick as possible. To aid in this, there are several different options on how items can be opened. You can configure your preference by setting the `target` property of any item, to one of the following values:
- `sametab` - The app will be launched in the current tab
- `newtab` - The app will be launched in a new tab
- `modal` - Launch app in a resizable/ movable popup modal on the current page
- `workspace` - Changes to Workspace view, and launches app

Even if the target is not set (or is set to `sametab`), you can still launch any given app in an alternative method: Alt + Click will open the modal, and Ctrl + Click will open in a new tab. You can also right-click on any item to see all options (as seen in the screenshot below). This custom context menu can be disabled by setting `appConfig.disableContextMenu: true`.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="https://i.ibb.co/vmZdSRt/dashy-context-menu-2.png" />
</p>

The modal and workspace views work by rendering the target application in an iframe. For this to work, the HTTP response header [`X-Frame-Options`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) for a given application needs to be set to `ALLOW`. If you are getting a `Refused to Connect` error then this header is set to `DENY` (or `SAMEORIGIN` and it's on a different host).

Here's a quick demo of the workspace view:
<p align="center">
  <img alt="Workspace view demo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/dashy/master/docs/assets/workspace-demo.gif" width="600" />
</p>

## Config Editor ‚öôÔ∏è

From the Settings Menu in Dashy, you can download, backup, edit and rest your config. An interactive editor makes editing the config file easy, it will tell you if you've got any errors. After making your changes, you can either apply them locally, or export into your main config file. After saving to the config file to the disk, the app will need to be rebuilt. This will happen automatically, but may take a few minutes. You can also manually trigger a rebuild from the Settings Menu. A full list of available config options can be found [here](./docs/configuring.md). It's recommend to make a backup of your configuration, as you can then restore it into a new instance of Dashy, without having to set it up again. [json2yaml](https://www.json2yaml.com/) is very useful for converting between YAML to JSON and visa versa.

## Sections & Items üóÉÔ∏è

Dashy is made up of a series of sections, each containing a series of items.

A section an be collapsed by clicking on it's name. This will cause only the title button to be visible until clicked, which is useful for particularly long sections, or those containing less-used apps. The collapse state for each section will be remembered for the next time you visit.

From the UI, you can also choose a layout, either `grid`, `horizontal` or `vertical`, as well as set the size for items, either `small`, `medium` or `large`, and of course set a theme using the dropdown. All settings specified here will be stored in your browsers local storage, and so won't persist across devices, if you require this then you must set these in the config file instead.

Within each section, you can set custom layout properties with under `displayData`. For example, you can make a given section double the width by making is span 2 columns with `cols: 2`, or specify how many rows it should span with `rows`. You can also set the layout for items within a given section here, for example, use `itemCountX` to define how many items will be on each row within the section. Sections can also have a custom color, specified as a hex code and defined using the `color` attribute. For full options for items, see the [`section.displayData` docs](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/configuring.md#sectiondisplaydata-optional)

Items also have some optional config attributes. As well as `title`, `description`, `URL` and `icon`, you can also specify a specific opening method (`target`), and configure status checks (`statusCheck: true/false`, `statusCheckUrl` and `statusCheckHeaders`), and modify appearance with `color` and `backgroundColor`. For full options for items, see the [`section.item` docs](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/configuring.md#sectionitem)

## Setting Dashboard Info üå≥

Page settings are defined under [`pageInfo`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/configuring.md#pageinfo). Here you can set things like title, sub-title, navigation links, footer text, etc

Custom links for the navigation menu are defined under [`pageInfo.navLinks`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/configuring.md#pageinfonavlinks-optional).

You can display either custom text or HTML in the footer, using the `pageInfo.footerText` attribute.

It's also possible to hide parts of the page that you do not need (e.g. navbar, footer, search, heading, etc). This is done using the [`appConfig.hideComponents`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/configuring.md#appconfighidecomponents-optional) attribute.

For example, a `pageInfo` section might look something like this:

```yaml
pageInfo:
  title: Home Lab
  description: Dashy
  navLinks:
  - title: Home
    path: /
  - title: Server Monitoring
    path: https://server-start.local
  - title: Start Page
    path: https://start-page.local
  footerText: 'Built with Dashy, by <a href="https://aliciasykes.com">Alicia Sykes</a>, 2021'
```

### Alternatives üôå

There are a few self-hosted web apps, that serve a similar purpose to Dashy. If you're looking for a dashboard, and Dashy doesn't meet your needs, I highly recommend you check these projects out! 
[HomeDash2](https://lamarios.github.io/Homedash2), [Homer](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer) (`Apache License 2.0`), [Organizr](https://organizr.app/) (`GPL-3.0 License`) and  [Heimdall](https://github.com/linuxserver/Heimdall) (`MIT License`)
